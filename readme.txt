AI-powered search for WordPress using Google Gemini. Smart answers, source links, and instant autocomplete — all in one modal.

== Description ==

Live demo: https://aisearch.mygeweb.com/

Geweb AI Search transforms your WordPress search into an intelligent assistant powered by Google Gemini AI. Instead of returning a plain list of matching posts, it understands the user's question and provides a direct, contextual answer — along with links to the source pages.

The plugin intercepts the standard WordPress search form and opens a modal with two modes: instant autocomplete suggestions (via WP_Query) and a full AI chat powered by Google Gemini File Search.

= Key Features =

* **AI-Powered Answers** — Uses Google Gemini File Search to find relevant content and generate natural-language answers
* **Conversation History** — Users can ask follow-up questions; the context is maintained across the session
* **Source Attribution** — Every AI answer includes links to the pages it was based on
* **Instant Autocomplete** — Traditional keyword search with live suggestions while typing
* **Automatic Indexing** — Posts are automatically uploaded to Gemini when published or updated
* **Bulk Library Generation** — Index all existing content with one click and a live progress indicator
* **Multiple AI Models** — Choose between Gemini 2.5 Flash, 2.5 Pro, and Gemini 3 models
* **Multiple Post Types** — Index any public post type: posts, pages, or custom post types
* **Secure API Key Storage** — API key is encrypted with libsodium before being stored in the database

= How It Works =

1. The plugin converts your WordPress posts to Markdown format (with URL and title in frontmatter)
2. Each document is uploaded to a Google Gemini File Search Store
3. When a user submits a search query, Gemini searches the indexed documents and generates an answer
4. The answer is displayed in a chat modal along with source links

= Third-Party Services =

This plugin connects to the **Google Gemini API** to index your content and answer user queries.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it free? =

The plugin itself is free and open source (GPLv2). The Google Gemini API has a generous free tier — check current limits and pricing at https://ai.google.dev/pricing.

= What content is sent to Google? =

The title and body of your published posts and pages are converted to Markdown and uploaded to Google Gemini for indexing. User search queries are also sent to Gemini to generate answers. No personal user data is collected or sent.

= Does it work with WooCommerce products? =

Yes. Select "Products" in the post types settings and regenerate the library. Customers can then ask questions about your products and get AI-generated answers.

= Does it work with custom post types? =

Yes, any public post type registered in WordPress can be selected for indexing.

= What happens when I update a post? =

The plugin automatically re-indexes the post when it is saved as published. If the post is unpublished or deleted, the corresponding document is removed from Gemini.

= What happens if the API quota is exceeded? =

The AI search will return an error. The standard autocomplete search will continue to work normally since it uses WordPress's built-in search.

= Can I customize the AI prompt? =

Yes. Use the `geweb_aisearch_gemini_system_instruction` filter to modify the system instruction sent to Gemini.

= Can I customize the list of available models? =

Yes. Use the `geweb_aisearch_gemini_models` filter to add or remove models from the selector.

= Which Gemini models are supported? =

Currently: gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-pro, gemini-3-flash-preview, gemini-3-pro-preview. Gemini 3 models support structured JSON responses with source attribution. Gemini 2.5 models return plain text answers.
