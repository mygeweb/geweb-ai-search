Geweb AI Search transforms your WordPress search into an intelligent assistant powered by Google Gemini AI. Instead of returning a plain list of matching posts, it understands the user's question and provides a direct, contextual answer — along with links to the source pages.

The plugin intercepts the standard WordPress search form and opens a modal with two modes: instant autocomplete suggestions (via WP_Query) and a full AI chat powered by Google Gemini File Search.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Answers** — Uses Google Gemini File Search to find relevant content and generate natural-language answers
- **Conversation History** — Users can ask follow-up questions; the context is maintained across the session
- **Source Attribution** — Every AI answer includes links to the pages it was based on
- **Instant Autocomplete** — Traditional keyword search with live suggestions while typing
- **Automatic Indexing** — Posts are automatically uploaded to Gemini when published or updated
- **Bulk Library Generation** — Index all existing content with one click and a live progress indicator
- **Multiple AI Models** — Choose between Gemini 2.5 Flash, 2.5 Pro, and Gemini 3 models
- **Multiple Post Types** — Index any public post type: posts, pages, or custom post types
- **Secure API Key Storage** — API key is encrypted with libsodium before being stored in the database

## How It Works

1. The plugin converts your WordPress posts to Markdown format (with URL and title in frontmatter)
2. Each document is uploaded to a Google Gemini File Search Store
3. When a user submits a search query, Gemini searches the indexed documents and generates an answer
4. The answer is displayed in a chat modal along with source links

- PHP 7.2 or higher (libsodium is bundled with PHP 7.2+)
- WordPress 6.0 or higher
- Google Gemini API key — free at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
